                                           # HSR-LeadSphere
   Project Description
 HSR-LeadSphere is a desktop-based web application designed as a one-stop solution for managing automotive sales leads at HSR Motors. The platform streamlines lead tracking, improves sales team visibility, and provides actionable insights through clean dashboards and visual data representations.
The application was built with a focus on UI/UX best practices to ensure ease of use for internal teams. A central Lead Management module allows users to view, filter, and manage incoming leads, while integrated data visualizations (including a pie chart for lead status distribution) help teams monitor performance in real time.
